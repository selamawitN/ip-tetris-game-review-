## User Experience

The Tetris game features a clean and intuitive interface, clearly displaying the game board, score, level, and lines cleared. Control instructions are easy to follow, allowing players to quickly understand and interact with the game. The layout of the canvas alongside the informational panel enhances visual clarity and usability.

While the interface is functional, several improvements could enhance engagement and playability:

- **Next-Piece Preview:** Shows upcoming tetrominoes for better strategic planning.  
- **Hold-Piece Mechanic:** Allows storing a piece for later use, adding tactical depth.  
- **Visual and Audio Feedback:** Line-clear animations, piece-drop effects, and sound cues increase immersion.  
- **Smooth Animations:** Animated piece movements reduce abrupt visual transitions.  
- **Accessibility Enhancements:** Consistent key recognition across browsers and prevention of default key actions (e.g., scrolling) improve playability.  
- **Difficulty Scaling:** Adjustable levels or incremental drop speed maintain challenge and replay value.

These enhancements would significantly improve player satisfaction, engagement, and retention, bringing the game closer to professional Tetris standards.
